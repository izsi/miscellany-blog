This blog is written by Izsy, a human with various interests including video games, history and wildlife. Izsy speaks English (UK) and Japanese. Formerly a software engineer, Izsy also studied Geography a while ago. Izsy is tired of being asked "where are you from?" anywhere and everywhere by people who haven't considered what they actually mean by "from". Izsy is very partial to tea.
