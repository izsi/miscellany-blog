The Sengoku Period during the 16th century in Japan was an era of battles, brought about by the collapse of the central government led by the shogun, the most powerful of the samurai class. This class was made up of clans who fought as warriors in times of conflict and worked as local rulers and bureaucrats during peace. As a result of the power vacuum left by the weakened government, numerous samurai lords who held domains across the country saw an opportunity to expand their lands and even seize control of Japan itself. What ensued was several decades of turmoil characterised by clashes between these lords as they fought to defend their lands and expand their powers. Effective communication over distance was crucial to success in battle and in diplomacy, and an environment where surprise attacks, defections and espionage were commonplace meant that the speed and integrity of delivery was a matter of life or death. But in an age with no Internet or radio, how did distant warriors talk to each other and how did they direct their armies on an ever-changing battlefield?

Detailed information was best sent by letter, carried by a trusted messenger. Different conventions in language and presentation were used for different purposes. For example, formal documents such as guarantees of territory to vassals were stamped with a seal and diplomatic negotiations were completed with a signature to prove authenticity. On the other hand, personal correspondence did not require a date of writing, sometimes making interpretation challenging for historians. Wording was also crucial when negotiating with other powerful samurai; write too haughtily and you risk angering the recipient, but be too modest and they may not consider it worthwhile to respect your wishes.

Many letters from the samurai of the time survive, kept by recipients and passed down the generations to the present day. Date Masamune, who ruled the Dewa and Mutsu domains, was a prolific letter-writer and it appears that many people unused to receiving correspondence from such a high-ranking figure treasured these letters. As a result, many examples of his writing have survived, even some about quite trivial matters. Conversely, some figures have very little surviving material due to the circumstances after their death. Ishida Mitsunari was defeated by Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara and executed, after which nearly all his possessions and documents were destroyed in an effort to wipe out his legacy. Centuries later, some friendly correspondence between him and a lord called Sanada Nobuyuki was discovered in a box thought to contain a sword gifted from Ieyasu. They had survived through the ages when Mitsunari was a taboo figure thanks to this concealment. 

Within their own domains, all lords maintained a network of inns that kept horses at the ready for messengers to switch between so they could travel swiftly without exhausting their mount. This enabled reliable communication between strategic points within domains and neighbouring allies. However, problems arose when having to traverse through enemy territory. In the turmoil of the Sengoku Period there were times when having a letter intercepted could mean the death and destruction of your entire clan. For example, when allied forces located apart were coordinating an attack on a powerful faction, or when a vassal sent a reply to an enemy force agreeing to defect and betray their lord. Survival was generally more important than honour in this period and turncoats were common, but if your lord caught wind of your treachery they would most likely execute you and your family. In cases like these, a trusted retainer was sometimes sent in place of a regular messenger, carrying a letter to prove the authenticity of his mission, but with the sensitive details omitted. The retainer would then verbally deliver the missing information, minimising the risk that would arise from the letter being stolen. Ninjas have over time become fabled figures, but they were active during this period in very real terms as spies and assassins, so protecting classified information was crucial in preventing your enemies getting the upper hand. 

Smoke signals had already been in use for centuries in Japan and became very important during this period of wars. They were limited in the amount of information that could be conveyed and the distance over which the signal was visible, but the lords of the time created networks of signalling points spaced across their domains, enabling a signal to be relayed across the land along a predetermined course. Fire was used during the night when smoke was not visible, but both could be hampered by weather conditions such as heavy rain, strong wind and thick fog. Nevertheless this method was crucial for generals, used for example when an enemy attack was detected. In this case, a smoke signal would go up at the border under attack and be relayed along the network to the domain’s central castle. The lord there would thus be quickly notified of the invasion and could tell the location from the course the signal had come from. It is not known exactly how information was conveyed but accounts suggest that basic things such as the rough size of an enemy force were signalled using more than one pillar of smoke.

On the battlefield, being able to direct your forces promptly and precisely meant the difference between life and death; no matter how large or well equipped your army, if it could not be commanded it amounted to little more than a chaotic rabble. Generals would execute military strategy using commands for advancing, retreating, rallying into tight formation, spreading into loose formation and so on. These commands had to transmit across the battlefield and be recognised by troops engaged in fighting. Messengers on horseback were used in certain situations, but the most ubiquitous form of command was a selection of instruments whose sound could project over the din of battle. Large drums were used with different beats signalling advance or retreat. Based on later depictions from the Edo Period, it is thought that these drums might have been carried by a soldier on their back, so that the general could beat the drum as needed whilst maintaining mobility. Another use for drums that should not be underestimated was to boost morale; a strong drumroll would lend courage to troops before a charge.

Whilst drums were somewhat limited in the distance their sound could travel, large bells had the benefit of a wider range. These were hung from a frame like church bells, but instead of having a clapper that hit the sides when swung, they were rung by hitting the bell with a wooden pole. Bells used on the battlefield were generally between around 30 to 70 centimetres in height, but sometimes larger ones were borrowed from temples. These were extremely heavy and not suited for frequent movement so they would be taken opportunistically from a nearby temple and set up at a strategic location. One would hope they were returned after use, not least because angering monks could have dire consequences during this period.

Conch shells, originally used by mountain ascetics as part of their religious practices, were blown to produce a horn-like sound. In earlier times, ascetics were recruited to sound them, but by the Sengoku Period they were used by the generals themselves and became a symbol of military rank. Different sounds could be produced to signal different meanings to an army and they had the benefit of being highly portable whilst having a certain amount of volume and projection.  

All these methods had their strengths and weaknesses and they were used in combination according to the situation at hand. Effective communication was key to survival in such an age when yesterday’s friend could easily become today’s foe, as well the other way round. The samurai of the period therefore needed to be resourceful in choosing their methods and had to constantly maintain certain standards, such as managing checkpoints for messengers and training armies to recognise different signals. For us today, the aural signals remain somewhat enigmatic since we have no recordings to refer to, but the letters exchanged by the people of the time provide invaluable insights into many aspects of their lives.
