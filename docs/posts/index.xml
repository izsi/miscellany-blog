      <description>The Sengoku Period during the 16th century in Japan was an era of battles, brought about by the collapse of the central government led by the shogun, the most powerful of the samurai class. This class was made up of clans who fought as warriors in times of conflict and worked as local rulers and bureaucrats during peace. As a result of the power vacuum left by the weakened government, numerous samurai lords who held domains across the country saw an opportunity to expand their lands and even seize control of Japan itself.</description>

      <description>This is not a serious guide to identifying birds.
This is a brief introduction to some of the common birds you can find in Britain, which I have written because I delight in seeing them out and about their business and I think some other people might too, given a chance. Whilst rushing around getting on with life or ruminating and not getting on with life, I find just pausing a moment to notice a bird and watch it doing its birdy activities inexplicably joyous.</description>

      <description>Out in the countryside of central Japan, somewhere in between the cities of Kyoto and Nagoya is the small town of Sekigahara. From the window of a train it looks like nothing much, just a modest country town surrounded by fields and woods, but this place is sure to be found in any textbook of Japanese history. In the autumn of 1600 Sekigahara, already an important crossroad for the regionâ€™s transport links, also became a crossroad in history, staging one of the largest battles in Japan at the time.</description>

      <description>Battle stages teeming with soldiers, a colourful cast of powerful generals based on historical figures, controls that are easy to pick up and provide extravagant action sequences perfect for stress-relief; these are some of the core features of the long-running Dynasty Warriors series. The fast-paced, action-focussed system has changed little over time, arguably because it does what it does very well, but has faced criticism for lack of innovation. The latest installment in the series has taken a large step away from the familiar formula and leapt into an open-world setting.</description>
