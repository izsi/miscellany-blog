			<i>Notes from a casual birdwatcher to the absolute beginner</i>
		</aside><p>This is not a serious guide to identifying birds.</p>
<p>This is a brief introduction to some of the common birds you can find in Britain, which I have written because I delight in seeing them out and about their business and I think some other people might too, given a chance. Whilst rushing around getting on with life or ruminating and not getting on with life, I find just pausing a moment to notice a bird and watch it doing its birdy activities inexplicably joyous. When I say &ldquo;common&rdquo; I do not mean that in a dismissive way; each of these birds have their own character and beauty and are resourceful enough to have found ways to live alongside us as we rapidly change our surroundings. Of course, knowing the names of the species is not necessary to enjoy their presence, but it can help stick them in your mind and is useful when you want to find out more about them. I have also found myself enjoying imparting my basic knowledge to family and friends when they’re wondering what they just saw.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this is written by a suburban Londoner, and is therefore most relevant to inhabitants of English cities. They are all birds that can be seen in gardens, parks and fields in and just outside town. This certainly doesn't cover all the birds you are likely to see; I wanted to include more, but I also wanted to actually finish the article.</p>
<p>The references to the relative sizes of the birds won’t mean much at first, but once you get used to identifying some of them, the comparisons will make much more sense. Bird calls can also be quite bewildering, so don't worry about that at first. If you check out a few of the obvious ones like magpies, green woodpeckers and jackdaws using audio recordings (see references at the end of this article) and notice them around, others can follow in a step-by-step process. The habits of the different species are also very useful in helping to identify them; blackbirds forage on the lawn by themselves while starlings often flock on rooftops, pied wagtails hop about on the ground while long-tailed tits flit through the trees in groups, nuthatches climb trees while wrens hide in the undergrowth, and so on. These are of course not rules set in stone, but knowing how the species make a living is key to getting to know them. Happy birdwatching!</p>
<h3 id="robin">Robin</h3>

You can already identify this bird. If you’re not quite sure, here’s a reminder: small and round, mostly brown, with a red breast. Have a look at your Christmas cards. The orangey-red front is unmistakable, is there all year round on both males and females, and they are quite happy to hop around close by so you can get a good look. They are also fairly active in winter when many other birds are hushed, and have a warbling song that sounds sweet to human ears but acts as a warning to other robins: this is my territory! Robins like to perch a few feet above the ground looking for insects to grab and have a habit of following large animals like deer and boar who expose hidden minibeasts as they root around. This habit extends to human gardeners too, as they are known to watch us dig and flit down to catch dinner when it appears!</p>
<h3 id="pigeons">Pigeons</h3>
<p>You know the city pigeon. It is also known as the ‘feral rock dove’ in case you miss it in a proper bird identification guide. They come in all sorts of patterns which can be fun to observe whilst out of the office during lunchtime trying to take your mind off work.<br>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/everyday_birds/woodpigeon-274834_640.jpg"
         alt="Woodpigeon"/> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

Another common one is the woodpigeon, bigger and fatter with a grey upper body, pinkish breast and white patches on either side of the neck. It still has the pigeon-ey face with its small head and wide-eyed look. They are less urban and can be found in neighbourhoods with parks and big trees. Quite pretty but still very personable, they can be found cooing exuberantly on the roof and clapping their wings noisily as they take flight. Seeing a flock of them clumsily trying to eat berries off of thin wobbly branches is endlessly amusing.<br>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/everyday_birds/collared-dove-4778198_640.jpg"
         alt="Collared dove"/> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

Collared doves are also widespread in the British Isles, roughly the same size as the urban pigeon but coloured in a tastefully blended pinkish-greyish-beige, with wings being more beige and breast more pink. They also have a black half-collar edged with white, giving them their name. Overall they look altogether more refined than their scruffy feral relatives and portly woodpigeon kin. They coo in three-coo phrases.</p>
<h3 id="blackbird">Blackbird</h3>
<p><figure>
    <img src="/images/everyday_birds/blackbird-4124250_640.jpg"
         alt="Blackbird"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Blackbird

</figure>

It’s not a crow. It is all black, but you can’t confuse it with a crow because it is much smaller and has a thin yellow bill. You may also notice the yellow ring around its eye giving it a bit of extra charm. A member of the thrush family, famed for its singers, the humble blackbird also has a lovely song; melodious, varied and seemingly effortless. Apart from this song, you are also likely to hear its shrill alarm call as it alerts other birds to your presence. They are ground feeders, often found pecking about on the lawn. You may notice that some of them are, on closer inspection, dark brown rather than black; these are the females and young males.</p>
<h3 id="sparrow">Sparrow</h3>
<p><figure>
    <img src="/images/everyday_birds/sparrows-3419660_640.jpg"
         alt="House sparrows"/> <figcaption>
            <p>House sparrows

        </figcaption>
</figure>

Sparrow decline is much talked about and has been very noticeable over the past century. They were able to thrive in and around human civilisation, but something has caused their populations to dramatically fall away and we’re not quite sure what. In all likelihood, a complex mix of different factors are probably at play.
The house sparrow, which is what we generally mean when we say sparrow, is a small round bird with a short thick bill, brown wings and a light breast. The males have a smart black bib and grey cap, while the females are more plain, with a pale eye-stripe and no cap or bib. They are often found in flocks, merrily chirruping away to each other.</p>
<h3 id="magpie">Magpie</h3>
<p><figure>
    <img src="/images/everyday_birds/birds-3972760_640.jpg"
         alt="Magpie"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Magpie
                    <a href="https://pixabay.com/images/id-3972760/">image source</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

Just so you know, they are not murdering all the nice little birds. There are many different reasons for fluctuations in bird populations but an increase in magpies is not accountable for large reductions in songbird numbers. The numbers simply do not add up once you look into where the magpies have become more numerous, where the other birds have declined and what species have shown changes. For more information, see <a href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/magpie/effect-on-songbirds/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/magpie/what-do-magpies-eat/">here</a>. They do sometimes snatch eggs and fledglings, but that is nothing compared to how we have changed the environment.<br>
Magpies are medium sized, boldly black-and-white birds with a black head, white front and white upper wings. The tail is noticeably very long and can appear black, but has a blue-green sheen to it, as does its wings. They have a harsh <em>chakka chakka</em> call and are quite at home on the lawn, making their presence very noticeable to us. Since they spend a lot of time out and about as a couple, if you see one magpie it is highly likely that you can spot another close by, so the saying “one for sorrow, two for joy” sounds quite optimistic once you know this.</p>
<h3 id="jay">Jay</h3>
<p><figure>
    <img src="/images/everyday_birds/animal-4778536_640.jpg"
         alt="Jay"/> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

The jay can be quite startling if you’re not in the habit of noticing it. Being woodland birds, they like to hide in trees and are thus mostly not that visible even when present in suburban neighbourhoods, occasionally causing a nice surprise by coming out into the open. They are mostly a light pinkish brown with a black tail, black wing-tips and black moustache that give them a smart edge, and then a brilliant blue patch on the wings for flair. When flying away from you, the white rump is particularly noticeable. They are in fact a relative of the crow, although you wouldn’t guess it from this exciting departure from their dour attire. Famous for burying acorns, they collect and hide literally thousands of them in one autumn. This is also when you’re most likely to see them come out from amongst the branches as they busily commute between oak trees. Their furious screeching call can help in realising they are indeed around.</p>
<h3 id="pied-wagtail">Pied Wagtail</h3>
<p><figure>
    <img src="/images/everyday_birds/pied-wagtail-4969777_640.jpg"
         alt="Pied wagtail"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Pied wagtail

        </figcaption>
</figure>

We have here a very small dainty grey, white and black bird with a long tail that it likes to flick up and down, just to make sure you know it is a wagtail. They turn up in unexpected places if you happen to look down and notice, wagging about the carpark or dodging commuters on the pavement. They dance about in open spaces snatching insects to eat and at dusk can gather in large flocks to roost.<br>
There is also the grey wagtail, whose bright lemon-yellow breast is much more noticeable than the grey wings, tail and head. They also like to walk on the ground while flicking their long tails and are usually found near water.</p>
<h3 id="tits">Tits</h3>
<p><figure>
    <img src="/images/everyday_birds/blue-tit-4781752_640.jpg"
         alt="A blue tit on the left and a great tit on the right"/> <figcaption>
            <p>A blue tit on the left and a great tit on the right

        </figcaption>
</figure>

Yes, that is what they are called. The most noticeable of the tit family are the blue tits and great tits, the only ones with bright yellow breasts. The blue tit is tiny, with a small bright blue cap on its head, blue wings and a green back, overall creating a very cheery palette with the bright yellow front. The great tit is bigger, with a large black cap and a thick black stripe down the middle of its yellow breast. It also has a rather insistent two-note song that it repeats endlessly, something like <em>teacher, teacher!</em> The blue tit tends to sing one or two high notes followed by a rapid twitter, also repeated. Both are often seen flitting about on thin tree branches and are welcomed on bird feeders where their bright colours and acrobatic feeding make them very popular.<br>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/everyday_birds/long-tailed-tit-4758031_640.jpg"

        </figcaption>
</figure>

Another distinctive one is the long-tailed tit, an incredibly cute bird with a tiny round body and comparatively very long tail. It has a white head and white belly tinged with pink, contrasting with the bold black strips on the wings, tail and sides of the head. They often grace us with their presence in small flocks, fluttering from tree to tree, chirruping away to each other.<br>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/everyday_birds/animal-3209424_640.jpg"
         alt="Coal tit"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Coal tit

        </figcaption>
</figure>

There are also the more subtly-coloured relatives, the most common of which is the coal tit, shaped mostly like a blue but much less flamboyantly coloured, with an overall greyish appearance. It has a black cap, white cheeks, a white patch on the back of its neck, a slate-grey back and dark grey wings with white bars. It is also behaves much less boldly, only briefly flitting out of the leaves to grab a nut from the bird feeder and quickly dashing off to cache it away.</p>
<h3 id="nuthatch">Nuthatch</h3>
<p><figure>
    <img src="/images/everyday_birds/nuthatch-915435_640.jpg"
         alt="Nuthatch"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Nuthatch

        </figcaption>
</figure>

The nuthatch is a small bird that is grey on top with a lighter belly, chestnut sides and a bold black line across the eye. It also has a thin long-ish beak that it uses for probing and prying tree bark, apparently perfectly happy walking vertically down a tree. It also likes seeds and is capable of scaring the tits off a bird feeder, despite being roughly the same size. The nuthatch has a whistling call and likes to repeat the same phrase over, making it far from a virtuoso, but its voice often has a memorable melancholy tinge to it.</p>
<h3 id="starling">Starling</h3>
<p><figure>
    <img src="/images/everyday_birds/animal-1851604_640.jpg"
         alt="Starling - be warned, they can look much darker at a distance!"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Starling - be warned, they can look much darker at a distance!
                    <a href="https://pixabay.com/images/id-1851604/">image source</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

The common starling can be surprisingly perplexing. At a distance, it looks black, resembling a blackbird, but once you get close it is actually speckled (more so in winter) and has a glossy green and purple sheen. It is slightly smaller than a blackbird with a head that looks proportionally bigger, and can look a bit scruffy when it has its spiky neck feathers puffed out. As well as having their own clicking noises and dizzying glissando whistles they are superb mimics, reproducing all sorts of noises from their environment, including the voices of other birds and farm animals. I have heard them doing quite convincing car alarm impressions. Starlings are gregarious birds that can form enormous flocks, flying around in a gigantic shifting shape in the dusk sky before settling to roost. Anyone who has seen this will agree it is a spectacular display.<br>

This bird looks exactly as you would hope from the name; definitely green, with the woodpecker’s sturdy-looking straight bill and red cap, plus a black  mask. As you would also expect from a woodpecker it eats insects, but is often seen pecking about for ants on the lawn rather than drilling in trees. It has a great call often referred to as a <em>yaffle</em>, which sounds like an outburst of maniacal laughter. Whether you’re going for a leisurely stroll or rushing out of the house for a morning meeting, this bird will find it all very hilarious.</p>

</figure>

With his bright reddish-orange plumage combined with a blue-grey crown and black-and-white markings on the wings, the male chaffinch is unmistakable, even when his colours become a bit duller in winter. The female is mostly greenish-brown, but in both sexes the white wing patches are very noticeable as they fly away from you. They are small birds that like to lurk in bushes and feed on the ground in little groups.</p>

The stubby, cocked-up tail is the most obvious sign you are looking at a wren. They are tiny, round, brown birds with barred markings, paler undersides, thin bills and the aforementioned jauntily-angled tail (the angle isn’t permanent, it is a stance they like to take whilst perching). They have an enthusiastic and astonishingly loud song considering their diminutive size, often ending phrases with a warbling trill. Despite the ostentatious impression the song and the tail give, wrens tend to lurk in dense undergrowth and are much more often heard than seen, communicating to each other whilst staying safe.</p>

Of the crow family, known as the corvids, “the” crow is the carrion crow. Large and hefty-looking with glossy all-black feathers, a thick black bill, black legs, beady black eyes etc… this bird is black all over. It also has the harsh <em>caw caw</em> call you expect from a crow.<br>
<figure>

The hooded crow is a very close relative of the carrion crow with much the same shape but with large patches of grey across its body. They are more common than the carrion in certain parts of the British Isles and can also interbreed, creating hybrids.<br>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

There is the rook, which is very similar in stature to the carrion crow and has a similar but less harsh call that's more varied than the triple <em>caw</em> of the carrion. If you’re close enough, the white bald patch at the base of the bill is a clear sign you are looking at a rook. They build rookeries and are more gregarious than carrion crows; this can be used as a distinguishing feature, but is not always reliable because rooks can act alone and crows are known to flock. If in doubt, you can bemuse the uninitiated and infuriate birdwatchers by declaring in a serious voice that “it’s a corvid”.<br>

The jackdaw is also a rather black bird, but it has a grey area on the side and back of its head which is quite noticeable once you know what you’re looking for. It is also decidedly smaller than the previous two and says “jack”. Well, apparently it does anyway; it can also be written as <em>tchack!</em> This short, relatively high-pitched call is very different from the laid-back caw of the bigger crows.<br>
The corvid family actually also includes other birds such as magpies and jays, but these look significantly different and are thus covered in their own sections.</p>
<h3 id="grey-squirrel">Grey Squirrel</h3>
<p>This is not a bird. I include it here because it makes some very strange squawking noises that in the past I assumed were birds. <em>Gek gek gek&hellip; kwaaaaaarrk?!</em> Here's a video I found for your perusal.<br>

The descendants of escaped pets, ring-necked parakeets (also known as rose-ringed parakeets) have made themselves at home in the UK, particularly in south-east England. I can testify that they are abundant in many of the larger parks around London. Being the only naturalised parrot in the country, the parrot shape with large round head, chunky hooked beak and long pointed tail are an instant giveaway. Their plumage is an eye-catching lime green, with a pink and black ring around the neck, like the gills slits of a fish. They’re also very vocal, so once you learn the insistent squeaking call it’s easy to notice when they’re around as they call to each other whilst flying overhead from tree to tree.</p>
<h3 id="kestrel">Kestrel</h3>

Next to the motorway or over a field, if you see a medium-sized bird in an astonishingly stable hover, it’s probably a kestrel. They are falcons with the characteristic slim, swept-back wings, hooked bill and intense stare. The males are very pretty with auburn wings, a steely grey head and if you look closely, a black moustache, while the females are more brown all over, with the same paler underparts and dark wing-tips. They have a rather endearing squeaking call you might not expect from a bird of prey. Kestrels mostly hunt small mammals such as voles, scanning the countryside from a lookout post or from the sky, using their magically motionless hover to pinpoint the location of prey before swooping down (not as dramatically as the peregrine) to catch it.</p>
<h3 id="buzzard">Buzzard</h3>

The buzzard is the most common of our big birds of prey. They are large and brown with highly variable white patterning, looking chunky when perched and sporting big broad wings in flight, often held out straight as they soar. They have half-open-fan-shaped tails (contrast the rounded edge with the wedge-shaped red kite tail) with a barred pattern, and generally have large white windows across the undersides of the wings, also barred and edged with dark brown. Sometimes they will do a kestrel impression, hovering in the air and watching the ground, but they are bigger, less pointy and aren’t as impossibly balanced as the kestrel. I have found that if you tell an American you saw a buzzard near home, they will be impressed and rather surprised, as it means vulture over there.</p>
<h3 id="red-kite">Red Kite</h3>

The bird identification book handed down from my father, published in 1989 (the first edition even earlier), puts the red kite in the supplementary list of rare birds, stating it is confined almost exclusively to the Welsh mountains. They were nearly driven to extinction here in the UK by us humans, but happily they have recovered significantly and are now much more common. As well as the Brecon Beacons and Snowdonia, I have seen them in the Chilterns, the South Downs, and even suburban Hertfordshire. They are a bird of prey and true to their name, have reddish-brown bodies. They are usually seen flying above, and can be distinguished from the buzzard by the forked tail shape and slim, angled wings with defined white patches near the ends.</p>
<h3 id="swan">Swan</h3>

The black knob on top of the orange beak tells you it is a mute swan. While they are quieter than many other species of swan, they do make grunting and hissing noises. Famous for mating for life, the parents raise young together and are fiercely protective of their offspring, sometimes even attacking rowing boats and canoes if they feel threatened. The familiar posture with their wings half-raised over their backs is known as busking, and is a display for threatening potential enemies. However, it appears that they also use this pose for &ldquo;wind-surfing&rdquo; across open water.<br>
There are some other species of swan that can be seen in Britain, but these are rarer winter visitors. If you see a swan that is definitely not a mute swan, then get out the bird book or better still, ask someone knowledgeable on such matters.</p>

They are both round black birds, smaller than the ducks that they are often found alongside on ponds and lakes. But once you memorise this one difference, it is very easy to tell them apart: moorhens have red bills with a yellow tip, coots have white bills and a prominent white “shield” on the forehead. That is all it takes, but if you inspect them more closely, you will also see that the coot is bigger and has all-black feathers, whereas the moorhen is smaller and has a dark brown back, with white flecks on the sides. If you happen to see them walking about on land, they also have rather interesting feet. The coot has grey feet with lobes or flaps on the sides of the toes it uses for swimming, while the moorhen has yellow feet with long thin toes which it can use to walk on lily pads.
Moorhens tend to lurk in the vegetation on the margins of lakes, dashing away when disturbed, but coots are happy to swim about in the open and their breeding season dramas are readily observable from land.<br>

A very large bird with very long legs, a grey body and mostly white neck with some dashing black feathers on the head. Also note the large dagger-like bill which when combined with a fully extended neck becomes a veritable spear, used to catch fish. The grey heron is usually found standing motionless at the water’s edge, waiting for the perfect moment to grab its prey. They’re also generally seen alone unless you’ve found a popular roosting spot for them, like an island in a lake with some nice big trees. When in flight they still look very large with their broad wings and long legs held out behind them, but they fold their necks in close to their bodies, creating a silhouette you might not expect. When standing they also often lower their neck into a snaky S-shape.</p>

“Look! A penguin!” is what I like to say when I spot a juvenile cormorant. The large size, upright posture when standing, long beak, and black-back-white-front colouring makes them not entirely unlike penguins at a distance. They are also birds that make a living by diving into the water and catching fish. That is all the similarity there is though, and the adults are basically all black, with inconspicuous white patches on the cheeks and thighs. They also have broad wings that enable them to fly, which they often hang out to dry whilst standing by the water. Whilst being predominantly coastal birds, they are also found at lakes inland. An easily confused relative is the shag, which is very similar but smaller, can have a tuft on the back of its head, has no white patches, and cannot perch in trees. However the shag generally sticks to coasts and is solitary, so if you see a group of birds like this inland they are probably cormorants.<br>

<p><strong>Kilbraken, J. (1989). <em>The Easy Way To Bird Recognition</em>. 2nd ed. London: Kingfisher Books.</strong><br>
This is the identification book I mention in the section about red kites. It is a good book, but rather old and out of print now, so I recommend getting an up-to-date field guide. It shouldn’t be too large; an overly comprehensive book covering lots of rare visitors is not going to help when starting out. You can also get books with audio recordings of birds.</p>
<p><strong>The website of the RSPB (The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds)</strong> at <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk">www.rspb.org.uk</a> has an online bird identification guide with illustrations, descriptions, range maps and for many birds an audio recording as well.</p>
<p><strong>Barnes, S. (2005). <em>A Bad Birdwatcher’s Companion</em>. London: Short Books.</strong><br>
The inspiration for this article, a thoroughly enjoyable read introducing the most obvious birds in Britain, including characterful illustrations by Peter Partington. I also recommend <em>How to Be a Bad Birdwatcher</em> by the same author, a more personal account expressing the joys of birdwatching.</p>
<p><strong>Couzens, D. (2004). <em>The Secret Lives of Garden Birds</em>. London: A &amp; C Black Publishers Ltd.</strong><br>
A book containing short insights into what the birds in the garden are up to through the year, lively and easy to read but perhaps a little too anthropomorphic for some. It contains lovely illustrations by Peter Partington, although some of the images haven’t been resized very well.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Sewell</strong> and his books of pictures are also recommended if you like quirky illustrations of real-life birds.</p>
